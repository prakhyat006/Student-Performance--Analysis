## üéØ Overview

This project implements a machine learning solution to predict student performance in academic settings. By analyzing various factors such as study habits, demographic information, and academic history, the model can classify students into different performance categories, helping educators identify at-risk students and provide targeted support.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-class Classification**: Predicts student performance across multiple performance categories
- **Feature Engineering**: Comprehensive preprocessing of student data
- **Model Comparison**: Implementation and comparison of multiple ML algorithms
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- **Visualization**: Interactive plots and charts for data analysis
- **Prediction Interface**: Easy-to-use prediction system for new student data

## üìä Dataset

The dataset contains student information with the following key features:

- **Demographics**: Age, gender, family background
- **Academic History**: Previous grades
- **Study Patterns**: Study time, homework completion rates
- **Social Factors**: Family support, peer relationships
- **Performance Classes**: Target variable with multiple performance levels

### Target Classes
- **High Performance**: Students with excellent academic results
- **Medium Performance**: Students with average academic results  
- **Low Performance**: Students requiring additional support
